/*
    QUESTION::
        How often from 1970 â€“ 2016 was it the case that a
        team with the most wins also won the world series?
        What percentage of the time?

    GROUPS::
        * team
        * year

    FILTERS::
        * between 1970 and 2016
        * did win ws
        * team did have most wins per year

    CHARACTERISTICS::
        * count of team that did have the most wins and
          did win ws
        * pct of above

    BREAKDOWN::
        * which years had a ws?
        * Separately, rank each team per year based on total wins
        * Join both queries based on year and rank = 1
        * How many teams won ws?
        * What's the pct of the time?


    Example output:

        count | pct
        ___________
        foo   | bar
